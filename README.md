# An example architecure for an angular app

This is a way of laying out an app that makes sense to me. Missing: SMACSS for styles.

Not missing: browserify for everything, a magic template loader, a terrible data store.

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/saw/mang.git
npm install
gulp build
npm start
```
